# Spotify restart

## How it works:
This script is an AutoHotKey Script which kills the Spotify process, starting a new one, pressing play and minimizing the window again.

## Why?
Because it will skip ads, if currently playing an ad. And because I expect this to be a feature, I built something to use this feature.

## Autostart
Create a shortcut in "C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" to the location of your script, so the script automatically starts on every login without the need of manually starting the script on every login.

## Adaption
You will probably have to adjust the parameters defined right in the beginning. The default works for me but it may not work for you. You will have to find out by trial and error.
