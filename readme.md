# Spotify restart
## How it works:
This script is an AutoHotKey Script which kills the Spotify process, starting a new one, pressing play and minimizing the window again.

## Autostart
Place the ahk script in "C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" to automatically start the ahk script on every login without the need of manually starting the script on every login.
